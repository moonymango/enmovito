# Product Context: Enmovito

## Purpose and Problem Statement

Enmovito (Engine Monitoring Visualization Tool) addresses the need for pilots, maintenance personnel, and aviation enthusiasts to analyze and visualize engine data logs. Modern aircraft generate extensive data during operation, but this data is often difficult to interpret without proper visualization tools.

### Key Problems Solved

1. **Data Accessibility**: Raw engine log data in CSV format is difficult to interpret without visualization. Enmovito transforms this raw data into interactive, visual representations that make patterns and anomalies immediately apparent.

2. **Parameter Correlation**: Understanding relationships between different engine parameters (e.g., RPM vs. manifold pressure, CHT vs. EGT) is crucial for engine health monitoring and troubleshooting. Enmovito enables easy creation of XY plots to visualize these relationships.

4. **Parameter Organization**: Aircraft engine logs contain numerous parameters, making it challenging to find relevant ones. Enmovito's categorization system (GPS, Altitude, Engine, Temperature, etc.) simplifies parameter selection.

## Target Users

1. **Pilots**: Monitor engine performance trends over time to optimize operations and identify potential issues early.

2. **Maintenance Technicians**: Analyze engine data to diagnose problems, verify repairs, and ensure proper engine operation.

3. **Aviation Enthusiasts**: Explore and learn about aircraft engine performance characteristics.

4. **Flight Schools**: Teach students about engine management and performance through data visualization.

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity and Accessibility

- Users should be able to load and visualize data with minimal steps
- The interface should be intuitive, requiring little to no training
- Parameter selection should be straightforward through both individual selection and category-based grouping

### Interactive Exploration

- Users should be able to zoom, pan, and hover over data points to see exact values
- Changing parameters to visualize should be quick and responsive

### Insightful Visualization

- Plots should clearly show relationships and trends
- Multiple parameters should be viewable simultaneously for comparison
- Visual elements should help identify normal ranges and potential anomalies

## Workflow

1. **Data Selection**: User selects a CSV log file from their system
2. **Parameter Selection**: User chooses parameters to visualize, either individually or by category
3. **Visualization**: System generates interactive plots based on selected parameters
4. **Exploration**: User interacts with plots (zoom, pan, hover) to explore the data

## Value Proposition

Enmovito transforms complex engine data into accessible, interactive visualizations that enable:

- **Early Problem Detection**: Identify potential issues before they lead to failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Understand engine behavior to optimize operations
- **Maintenance Verification**: Confirm that maintenance actions resolved issues
- **Educational Insights**: Learn about engine behavior through data exploration

By making engine data accessible and understandable, Enmovito helps ensure safer operations, reduced maintenance costs, and improved engine longevity.
