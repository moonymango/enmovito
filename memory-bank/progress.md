# Progress: Enmovito

## Current Status

Enmovito is now in a fully functional state with core features implemented and recent bugs fixed. The application successfully loads engine data logs, visualizes parameters in both time series and XY plots, and provides an intuitive interface for data exploration with improved parameter filtering, plot management, and visualization capabilities. Recent additions include dark theme support, resizable plots, unified X-axis parameter selection, and a standalone executable package.

### Development Status: Beta

The application is stable for its core functionality but still has areas for improvement and feature additions before reaching a production-ready state. Recent bug fixes and UI enhancements have significantly improved stability and usability. The application has been successfully packaged into a self-contained executable for Linux, making it easier to distribute and use.

## Known Issues

### Performance Issues

1. **Large File Handling**
   - Loading very large CSV files can be slow
   - Memory usage increases significantly with file size
   - Plotting many parameters simultaneously can reduce responsiveness

2. **Visualization Rendering**
   - Initial rendering of Plotly visualizations can be slow with many data points
   - Multiple plots in time series view can lead to performance degradation

### UI Issues

1. **Parameter Selection**
   - Long parameter lists can be difficult to navigate
   - No search capability for parameters
   - Visual design of filtered parameter list could be improved

2. **Plot Interaction**
   - No way to save or export visualizations directly from the UI
   - Limited customization options for plot appearance
   - No annotations or markers for important events

### Technical Issues

1. **PyQt and Plotly Integration**
   - Memory leaks possible with multiple plot generations
   - Limited communication between Plotly interactions and PyQt application

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach

The project initially focused on creating a simple visualization tool for engine data logs with basic plotting capabilities. Key decisions included:

- Using PyQt for the GUI framework due to its cross-platform capabilities
- Implementing a basic file loading mechanism for CSV files
- Creating simple static plots for parameter visualization

### Current Approach

As the project evolved, several key decisions shaped its current state:

   - Started with a simple single-panel design
   - Evolved to a split-panel approach with resizable areas
   - Added tab-based organization for different visualization types
   - Implemented individual plot management with dedicated clear buttons
   - Added "Select All Visible" button for improved workflow
   - Removed global "Clear Plot" buttons in favor of individual plot management

3. **Parameter Organization**
   - Initially listed all parameters alphabetically
   - Added category-based organization to improve usability
   - Evolved from category-based selection to category-based filtering
   - Added visual indication of active category filters
   - Implemented "Select All Visible" functionality for quick selection of filtered parameters

4. **Data Handling**
   - Started with basic CSV parsing
   - Developed robust handling for the complex three-line header structure
   - Implemented proper mapping between abbreviated and full parameter names
   - Improved filtering of valid columns for display and analysis

5. **Visualization Capabilities**
   - Initially implemented basic time series plots
