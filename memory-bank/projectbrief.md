# Project Brief: Enmovito (Engine Monitoring Visualization Tool)

## Project Overview
Enmovito is a Python desktop application designed for visualizing and analyzing engine data logs from CSV files. The tool provides interactive time series visualization and analysis capabilities for engine monitoring data, allowing users to explore relationships between different engine parameters.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Data Loading and Parsing**
   - Load and parse CSV log files containing engine monitoring data
   - Handle specific CSV format with airframe information header
   - Support multiple time column options

2. **Visualization Capabilities**
   - Interactive time series plots for multiple engine parameters
   - XY scatter plots to analyze relationships between parameters
   - Parameter categorization for quick selection of related parameters
   - Customizable time axis selection

3. **User Interface**
   - Intuitive GUI with parameter selection
   - Plot controls (zoom, pan, tooltips)
   - Category-based parameter selection
   - File selection dialog

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Basic statistical analysis of engine parameters
   - Support for large datasets
   - Interactive data exploration

### Technical Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Efficient handling of large CSV files
   - Responsive UI during data loading and visualization

2. **Compatibility**
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Support for various CSV formats with minimal configuration

3. **Extensibility**
   - Modular design for adding new visualization types
   - Ability to add new parameter categories
   - Support for different data sources in the future

## Project Goals
1. Provide a user-friendly tool for pilots and maintenance personnel to analyze engine data
2. Enable quick identification of patterns and anomalies in engine performance
3. Support detailed analysis of relationships between different engine parameters
4. Create a foundation for more advanced engine monitoring and analysis tools

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully load and visualize engine data from example log files
2. Provide intuitive navigation and selection of parameters
3. Enable interactive exploration of time series data
4. Support creation of XY plots for parameter correlation analysis
5. Maintain responsive performance with large datasets
